# QUESTIONABLE

## APPLICATION DESCRIPTION ##

Questionable is a personal project designed to display my personal abilities creating a rails application from scratch. It is based off of the popular Q & A platform Quora.com, allowing users to ask questions, answer other users's questions, 'upvote' other user's answers and 'favorite' questions. 

From the home page you may fiter questions by those which are oldest, newest, most popular (favorited), have the most upvoted answers, and by category. 

The categories are all generated with the Faker gem, however when creating, editing, or even viewing another user's question, one can create new categories and apply them to the question at hand. To remove a category from a question, simply navigate to the question's show page and click on the category you'd like to remove. That category will then reappear in the dropdown of categories to add.
